听写笔记的方法和演示，以 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U7411a7xG 为例，仅参考：

1. 不看字幕，听写发音内容，不会的没关系，尽量写即可
2. 反复听几遍，然后继续把内容进行完善，直到无法继续写出来

Mother terisa, who received a noble pice prize from her work on behalf of the pool of india 87 years old.

反复几遍直到听不出：Mother terisa, who received a Noble Pace Prize from her work on behalf of poor and dies of dia cacke in India, she was 87 years old.

3. 到第二天或者查看答案，进行对比和完善总结，把不会的单词进行记录，跟读句子进行训练。

第二节答案：Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta India. She was 87 years old.

笔记：

- Teresa：人名，死记硬背
- Nobel Peace Prize：诺贝尔和平奖。Pace 的发音跟 Peace 有区别，Pace 是步伐、速度的意思。
- Calcutta：加尔各答，死记硬背

# Bruce Xu

Hi guys, I'm Bruce, co-initiator of LXDAO and ETHPanda. I live oversea, but I work remotely and mainly in Chinese communities, so my English skills are degenerating, therefore, I would like to co-learn with you guys to practice more.

I'm also preparing to join EDCON and other ETH global events, so English is very important for me.

## Do you think you will finish the whole CoLearning program?

Yes 100%

D1

- Mother Teresa, who received a Noble Peace Prize for her work onbehalf of the poor, dies of Cacula in India, she was 80 years old.

Fix:

- Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India - she was 87 years old.

Notes:

- onbehalf should be 'on behalf'
- Calcutta - Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is the capital of India's West Bengal state. Founded as an East India Company trading post, it was India's capital under the British Raj from 1773–1911.
- Nobel Peace Prize
- dies in Calcutta 是一个新的句子，之前以为是贫穷的死亡很多的印度的一个地方，实际上说的是她去世了，断句需要训练一下

D2

Fix:

- Jerry, what time do you have? I have 5 o'clock.
